Text file manipulation with the Ruby progamming language.

A tool for people who are fans of UNIX tools like cat / head / tail but realize
that they don't do certain things like offsets the ability to skip lines etc..

Thats where icersplicer comes in.

It also features fun keyword highlighting randomization and static keyword colours!

Checkout the keywords.ice in examples and copy it in your home foler under the .icersplicer directory
